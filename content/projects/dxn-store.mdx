## Overview

[![dxn store home page](dxn-store.png)](https://musaad.ai)

**DXN Store** is a custom webstore designed to sell DXN products across 11 countries. Built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with PHP powering the backend, this platform offers a tailored shopping experience with country-specific products and multi-currency pricing. The store provides a simple yet effective solution for DXN members to promote and sell products, integrating seamlessly with WhatsApp for order processing.

## Key Features

### **Multi-Country Support**

- **Country-Specific Products**: The store supports 11 different countries, displaying only the products available in each specific region.
- **Multi-Currency Pricing**: Prices are tailored to each country, allowing for accurate and localized pricing.

### **Product Display**

- **Quick View Modal**: Each product features a "Quick View" button, enabling users to view product details, pricing, and images in a modal without leaving the main page.
- **Product Information**: The modal displays essential product information, ensuring users can make informed purchasing decisions.

### **WhatsApp Integration**

- **Simplified Ordering Process**: Instead of online payments, each product includes a WhatsApp button. When clicked, users are redirected to WhatsApp with a pre-written message containing the product details, price, and quantity. This message is sent directly to the store owner, making the order process straightforward and personal.
- **Personalized User Links**: Admins can register users on the platform, providing them with personalized links. When customers use these links, the contact information and product order buttons redirect them to the respective user's WhatsApp, enabling a more personalized shopping experience.

## Admin Features

- **User Registration**: Admins can create and manage user accounts, allowing DXN members to have their own personalized storefronts within the platform.
- **Custom Redirects**: Each user’s link customizes the contact and ordering process, redirecting customers directly to the user’s WhatsApp, enhancing the connection between the seller and buyer.

## Client Story

This project was commissioned by a DXN member who needed a simple, effective way to manage and sell products across multiple countries. The DXN Store meets this need by providing a streamlined platform that integrates product display with WhatsApp communication, offering a unique approach to e-commerce that prioritizes personal interaction over automated transactions.

## Impact

- **User-Friendly Design**: The store’s straightforward design ensures that users can easily navigate and order products, even without online payment options.
- **Localized Experience**: By supporting country-specific products and pricing, the store offers a shopping experience that feels localized and relevant to each user’s region.
- **Enhanced User Engagement**: The integration with WhatsApp fosters direct communication between sellers and buyers, creating a more engaging and personalized shopping experience.
